                  Introduction to Participatory Politics
                </h2>
                <p>
                  My interview subject, unidentified by request, is an actively engaged citizen
                  and activist in Chicago. I conducted our interview over a Google Hangouts call,
                  and have selected some highlights from our discusion for listening below. For the
                  ease and natural flow of language, I will refer to him as Wallace.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wallace became interested in particpatory politics in late high school,
                  volunteering for a labor union. He was largely focused around the academic aspects,
                  focusing heavily on policy and debating classmates with the intention of winning over
                  his peers rhetorically.

                  A common thread in our discussion was shedding the weight of
                  being a "policy wonk" full-time, becoming radicalized, and
                  opting instead for direct involvement and activism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wallace identified some of his introductory political action early into our conversation,
                  detailing his work with Environmental Justice, a <a href="https://peoplesaction.org/people-and-planet-first/">People and Planet First</a> budget rally.
                  The primary demand of this rally was to provide budget for good-paying green jobs, and
                  participation motivated Wallace greatly.

                  In our increasingly globalized society, the concept of 'Citizenship' is one of interest.

                  Small '<b>c</b>' citizenship—defined more by acts than by status—has many forms.
                  Isin and Nielsen assert, <i>"Theorizing acts is part of a larger body of work that

                  One way of enacting citizenship is through activism, which Isin and Nielsen describe as
                  "writing the script" that defines citizenship. Though again their status may be overlooked
                  or suppressed by law, through acts of citizenship laws may be shaped or overturned; and some
                  bending of the law may often occur in the process.

                  Wallace sees eye-to-eye with this analysis. When asked if he could conceptualize the difference
                  between these types of citizenship, he immediately expressed familiarity with the subject. This
                  is a topic that concerns Wallace dearly, and drives him to stand in solidarity with DREAMers and
                  fight for the advancement of immigrant rights.
