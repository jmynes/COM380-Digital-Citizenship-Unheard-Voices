                  Introduction to Participatory Politics
                </h2>
                <p>
                  My interview subject, unidentified by request, is an actively engaged citizen
                  and activist in Chicago. I conducted our interview over a Google Hangouts call,
                  and have selected some highlights from our discusion for listening below. For the
                  ease and natural flow of language, I will refer to him as Wallace.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wallace became interested in particpatory politics in late high school,
                  volunteering for a labor union. He was largely focused around the academic aspects,
                  focusing heavily on policy and debating classmates with the intention of winning over
                  his peers rhetorically.

                  Wallace refers to holding immigrants passports, an illegal practice with little
                  crackdown as one of the injustices that got him interested in organizing. Pacific Standard Mag's

                  A common thread in our discussion was shedding the weight of
                  being a "policy wonk" full-time, becoming radicalized, and
                  opting instead for direct involvement and activism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wallace identified some of his introductory political action early into our conversation,
                  detailing his work with Environmental Justice, a <a href="https://peoplesaction.org/people-and-planet-first/">People and Planet First</a> budget rally.
                  The primary demand of this rally was to provide budget for good-paying green jobs, and
                  participation motivated Wallace greatly.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  In our increasingly globalized society, the concept of 'Citizenship' is one of interest.
                  Instead of <b>C</b>itizenship as status, <b>c</b>itizenship as practice manifests in the
                  <a href="http://routledgesoc.com/category/profile-tags/habitus">habitus</a> of a nations
                  inhabitants. Over time, through activism, spread of culture, resistance, and exercise of
                  rights, an individual cultivates citizenship in a way that most nations do not
                  formally recognize.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Small '<b>c</b>' citizenship—defined more by acts than by status—has many forms.
                  Isin and Nielsen assert, <i>"Theorizing acts is part of a larger body of work that
                  proposes a way of investigating genealogies of citizenship as a generalized question
                  of other-ness that includes strangers but also outsiders and aliens."</i>
                  One way of enacting citizenship is through activism, which Isin and Nielsen describe as
                  "writing the script" that defines citizenship. Though again their status may be overlooked
                  or suppressed by law, through acts of citizenship laws may be shaped or overturned; and some
                  bending of the law may often occur in the process.

                <p>
                  Wallace sees eye-to-eye with this analysis. When asked if he could conceptualize the difference
                  between these types of citizenship, he immediately expressed familiarity with the subject. This
                  is a topic that concerns Wallace dearly, and drives him to stand in solidarity with DREAMers and
                  fight for the advancement of immigrant rights.

                <p>
                  Wallace had a lot to say about people's consuming focus on policy in lieu of compassion,
                  emphasizing the importance of the latter. Even still, a worrying number of organizations
                  are described by Wallace as <i>"well-to-do, Liberal, and white"</i>, composed largely of people
                  who can afford to spend their extra time away from work on issues. This can result in missing out
                  on the perspective of the very people being affected, so Wallace instead posits that we should
                  focus more of our attention on organizations such as
                  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ProtectionForAllMovement/">Protection For All</a>,
                  which is made up of the people that they represent. This helps ensure we avoid tokenizing people,
                  and make sure their voices are heard and acts of citizenship are seen in their true light.

                  Wallace instructs our listeners and readers to engage with their peers, have important conversations, and share stories.
                  Conversations are critical to understanding, and we should make sure that the voices most often left out are also the
                  ones we need to hear right now.

                <p>
                  We wrapped up the interview with a call to action, Wallace implores that you look into the <a href="http://www.studentaccessil.com/">Student ACCESS</a> bill,
                  which aims to allow 4-year public universities in Illinois to aid undocumented students financially. This would not allow undocumented students
                  the MAP Grant, but plans to be revenue neutral as it grants universities the legal authority to offer financial aid to undocumented students,
                  but does not allocate any additional money or create any new particular scholarships. If our Illinois readers and listeners would like to support this bill,
                  call <a href="tel:12177822000">1-217-782-2000</a>, and tell your representative that you support the Student ACCESS Bill and you would like them to do the same.
