# Course syllabus's overview description
Extant research on the affordances of digital media technologies for social and political change points to the importance of digital media platforms as spaces for expressing voice and enacting new modes of citizenship. Scholars argue that while the era of traditional mass media shaped a dutiful citizen, the era of social media and user-generated content production facilitates the emergence of an actualizing citizen. The dutiful citizenship of traditional mass media is one that encouraged formal political participation like voting and maintaining a strong political party affiliation. Television, radio and newspapers provided information about government activities and the most salient economic, social and political issues of the day. The “mass” audiences relied on traditional media content to guide their participation in formal politics. This mode of citizenship is what Lance Bennett calls dutiful citizenship. Actualizing citizenship, on the other hand, is more substantive and is achieved through active participation and involvement in the production and circulation of cultural content about political, social and cultural issues/grievances that reflect the identities and struggles of its producer.
This course examines the implications of emerging digital media practices for citizenship, equality, participation and belonging. The course will first explore the intersection of media, communication and citizenship. We will also review emerging research findings and scholarly debates on the role of media technologies in carving spaces for expressing and enacting political/identity struggles. Some of the key themes this course will cover include: Marginality, youth activism, and citizenship; Youth citizenship and political participation; Networked publics & contentious politics; Gender and Citizenship; And digital citizenship in a global perspective.

# Project description
Students have the option to conceive and/or create a digital media project (e.g. Blog, YouTube channel, a civic media app) that would contribute to the practice of a particular dimension of citizenship for certain groups. The project will apply ideas and concepts developed in class to a creative/interventionist tool.

## What I chose to do with the above information
I have created a simple, mobile-first and responsive website which could be used again in the future to feature highlights of an interview with someone who's voice often goes unheard. I am not a particularly talented interviewer just yet, but in the future to prepare for conducting an interview I would probably practice more with a roommate or mirror.
